# Hidden Representation

The current repository accompanies the article "Hidden Representation: a new class of prior probability distributions for probabilistic numerical algorithms". In short, we propose a new way to introduce uncertainty in completely deterministic algorithms.

In [Six examples of hidden representation](https://github.com/VLSF/HiddenRepresentation/blob/master/Six%20examples%20of%20the%20hidden%20representation.ipynb) the method is illustrated on basic numerical tasks (integration, differentiation, interpolation, ...)

[Probabilistic iterative methods](https://github.com/VLSF/HiddenRepresentation/blob/master/Probabilistic%20iterative%20methods.ipynb) contains examples of the performance of more practical algorithms for large sparse linear systems.
